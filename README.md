Hey, Welcome

I designed and developed a visually stunning and functional frontend web page for Netflix, mirroring the actual platform's user interface. Using HTML and CSS, I crafted a responsive and intuitive layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

The homepage showcases a prominent hero section featuring a high-quality image and a clear call-to-action, inviting users to sign in or join the platform. Below, a curated list of popular content is displayed in a grid layout, with each item featuring a poster image, title, and ratings.

Users can navigate through various sections, including TV Shows, Movies, and My List, using the top navigation bar. Each section features a scrollable carousel, allowing users to discover new content effortlessly.

I incorporated Netflix's signature red color scheme and typography throughout the design, ensuring a consistent and recognizable brand identity. The web page is built using clean, semantic HTML and modular CSS, making it easy to maintain and update.

Key features include:

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Hero section with high-quality image and call-to-action
- Curated content grid with poster images, titles, and ratings
- Scrollable carousels for easy content discovery
- Consistent branding and typography throughout
- Clean, semantic HTML and modular CSS for easy maintenance

This frontend web page demonstrates my ability to create a visually appealing and functional user interface, mirroring the look and feel of a popular streaming platform like Netflix.
